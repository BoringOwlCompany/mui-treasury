# Migration

Migration task is not hard, just migrate component from deprecate project to this repo.

If you pick an issue [(example #176)](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-treasury/issues/176) in migration project or milestone, you need to look at this [deprecated repo](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-treasury-deprecate)

After you pull the deprecated repo down.
1. search the component (the same as issue name)
2. copy the component to mui-treasury repo
3. improve the code as needed.
