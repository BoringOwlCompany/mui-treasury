                I have been using Material-ui for a long time and I am a fan of
                it. In v0.x, theming and overrides was hard because it implement{' '}
                <Link
                  target={'_blank'}
                  href={'https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style'}
                >
                  inline-style
                </Link>{' '}
                as styling technique. Huge changes was made in v1.x, material-ui
                core team change from inline-style to{' '}

                  CSS-in-JS
                </Link>{' '}
                for styling components. It made theming and overriding easier
                than the previous version. However, it is still hard for new
                comers to adjust even a minor things.

                When writing components along with other logic, that can be
                painful. As a result, a lot of bugs occur. I want this project
                to be a place that you can look for components that you like,
                then customize a little bit, and finally copy to your project. I
                hope that this will help you focus on the logic of the web and
                release new great features to the world faster.

                3. Increase productivity
              </Text>
              <Text>
                I have seen a lot of developers struggled with building
                components instead of creating new features. I really love
                building UI, but it is not for everyone right? So, I want this
                project to be a place that you can copy the component that you
                like and paste it into your project, so that you have more time
                to focus on the other parts that you love. Imaging if we have
                thousands of components that we can choose from with fully under
                your control. It is the world I want to live in.
